This code extracts the value of several environmental factors for a set of archaeological sites and a set of random locations and describes how the set of random locations was created. Additionally, the code describes the comparison of the 
time and duration of human occupation of the archaeological sites and the historical land-use reconstructions of the last 6 ka BP from HYDE 3.2. The categories included in the comparison are population density and three anthropogenic land uses 
with varying levels of transformation: pasture, grazing, and converted rangeland.

Input by sections: 
1. Borneo boundary mask, UTM Borneo zones, Rivers layer, Bornean archaeological sites, CHELSA_TraCE21k_bio01 (6 ka BP, 4 ka BP, 2 ka BP, 0 BP), CHELSA_TraCE21k_bio12 (6 ka BP, 4 ka BP, 2 ka BP, 0 BP), CHELSA_TraCE21k_bio15 (6 ka BP, 4 ka BP, 2 ka BP, 0 BP).
2. Borneo boundary mask, UTM Borneo zones, Rivers layer, bounding polygon, Bornean archaeological sites, CHELSA_TraCE21k_bio01 (6 ka BP, 4 ka BP, 2 ka BP, 0 BP), CHELSA_TraCE21k_bio12 (6 ka BP, 4 ka BP, 2 ka BP, 0 BP), CHELSA_TraCE21k_bio15 (6 ka BP, 4 ka BP, 2 ka BP, 0 BP).
3. Previous outcomes section 1 and 2
4. Values of population density, pasture, grazing, and converted rangeland for archaeological sites. Matrix presence/absence of archaeological sites 

Output by sections: 
1-2. Environmental conditions value distribution random locations vs archaeological sites
3. Randomization test. 
4. Timing and durations of human presence and population density, pasture, grazing, and converted rangeland for archaeological sites.
